%% Specify path and file name for pose3d to save your 3D reconstruction related files in
% exp_path holds the name of the folder that gets created by pose3d for
% your experiment. This folder will be created in your present working directory.
% All experiments in this folder access the same calibration files
% Therefore, everytime you move cameras or record from a different setup
% change this name, otherwise you can keep this fixed

exp_path = 'playground_sessions_Luki_undistorted'; %./AllExperiments ** This name needs to be different only when you want to use different calibration data**

% exp_name holds the name of the session of your experiment 
% this is created as a folder withint exp_path directory by pose3d for your session specific data files

exp_name = 'Workshop_DLC'; % ./AllExperiments/Experiment1; **This name is to be different for every new experiment**

%If you are using DeepLabCut for 2D tracking or if your 2D tracking software also
%provides likelihood values ranging between 0 and 1 similar to DLC set this
%variable to 1; otherwise set this to 0
usingdlc = 1; 

%which mode of 3D reconstruction do you want to use
% 1. 'all' (2D tracked data from all cameras is used for reconstruction
% 2. 'bestpair' (2D tracked data from best camera pair is used for 3D
% reconstruction for every time point and feature)
% 3. 'avg' (3D reconstructed data averaged over pairs)
% You can also select more than 1 mode and all specified modes will be saved in the specified ordered in Data3d.mat, for instance by setting modes_3drecon = {'all', 'bestpair'};
modes_3drecon = {'avg'}; %this is the recommended mode (other possible modes are {'bestpair'},{'avg'}};
